A specially developed feature of cooperative investment

Collective investment functionality of SafeCrypt.io :

Investors with limited purchasing capacities may take advantage of a specially developed cooperative investment mechanism (Co-op) allowing investors to receive a major investment bonus from a collective contribution of multiple investors participating in such Co-op.

This type of bonus is also available during all phases of SafeCrypt ICO. A Co-op bonus is absolutely identical to the Major Investment bonus in the numbers behind it (bonus value ranges, minimum amount of tokens that must be purchased and schedule).

How it works:

1. Every user who created an account on SafeCrypt.io website is allowed to start a new Co-op or join an existing ongoing Co-op by entering a corresponding Co-op ID if such Co-op ID is known by the user.
2. A Co-op ID is a character-based identifier.
3. Each Co-op has it's own unique ID.
4. Any Co-op is time-limited and is active for 12 hours only.
5. A Co-op may not be stopped or restarted.
6. The number of participants in a Co-op is unlimited.
7. If Co-op participants collectively purchase the minimum amount of SFC required to receive a bonus, such Co-op is considered successful and each participant receives a number of bonus tokens corresponding to their purchase during the Co-op.

    Example: A user joins a Co-op on the fourth day of the pre-sale phase and purchases 50000 SFC while the Co-op is active (within 12 hours since the moment the Co-op started). The Co-op is successful and results in a total collective purchase of 150000 SFC which grants every participant with +15% bonus tokens.
    The user receives 50000 SFC + 7500 SFC as an additional bonus, 57500 SFC total.

8. An initiator of a successful Co-op (a user who started such Co-op) receives additional bonus tokens equal to 5% of a total number of tokens collectively purchased by the participants during the Co-op. This bonus has a fixed value that is not affected by time.
    Thus, having created a successful Co-op that resulted in a collective purchase of 1 mln. SFC, the Initiator receives 50000 SFC as an Initiator Bonus.
